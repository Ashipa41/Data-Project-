# Predicting Dengue Fever Outcomes Using Machine Learning on Haematological Data to Improve Diagnosis and Patient Management

# Introduction 

Dengue Fever is an illness spread through the bite of mosquitos carrying one of the Dengue Viruses. The virus is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including Central and South America, Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Research estimates that nearly 400 million people get infected by dengue each year, but most (about 80%) have no symptoms. The frequency of recorded dengue deaths is rather low, with the most frequently mentioned figure being approximately 20,000 deaths per year. 

## Dataset Description 

This dataset was collected from Mendeley Data. Containing 1,523 rows and 19 variables, patients at Jamalpur 250-Bedded General Hospital in Jamalpur, Bangladesh, from February 10, 2024, to September 27, 2024, following ethical guidelines with patient confidentiality protected. Each patientâ€™s clinical and hematological profile was meticulously recorded to ensure a detailed representation of dengue's impact on hematological parameters. 

## Some of The Variable:
- Gender
- Age
- Hemoglobin (g/dl)
- Neutrophils (%)
- Lymphocytes (%)
- Monocytes (%)
- Eosinophils (%)
- RBC (Red Blood Cell count)
- HCT (%) (Hematocrit)
## Dependent Variable:
- Result (positive/negative for dengue fever)

Purpose of the project: Analyze hematological data for dengue fever and develop machine learning models for prediction.
